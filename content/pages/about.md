Hello(:

I'm a Computer Science graduate from the National University of Singapore. My primary interest is in **computer security**, **computer networks** and **distributed systems**.

A dilettante in recreational mathematics. I enjoy historical fiction and dystopian novels. I post a mix of tech and non-tech content.
