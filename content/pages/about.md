Hello(:

I'm a final-year Computer Science undergrad at the National University of Singapore. My primary interest is in **computer security**, **computer networks** and **distributed systems**. 

> Check out some of my projects [here](/pages/projects/).

A dilettante in graph theory and urban geography. I enjoy historical fiction and dystopian novels. Open to book recommendations(:
