### Pose Estimator ###
**DSTA TIL Artificial Intelligence Hack 2019**
* Trained a pose estimator in Tensorflow/ Keras using Transfer Learning and the ensemble method.
* Won the 6th place in the competition (Merit Award)
* Could have done better using data augmentation techniques which I didn't know about earlier!
* [Repository](https://github.com/pikulet/til-ai-camp)

### Intellex Search Engine ###
**A weighted tf-idf information retrieval system**
* Created a search system for legal documents (data by Intellex)
* I worked on the indexing portion, as well as creating APIs to access the indexed data
* Having worked with the legal data let me understand the sheer complexity of legal information retrieval. Different court systems, different document formats and different terminology used are just some problems plaguing the legal industry.
* [Repository](https://github.com/pikulet/intellex)

### Poker Agent ###
**Artificial Intelligence**
* Combined the concepts of CounterFactual Regret (CFR) Minimisation and Deep-Q Networks (DQN) in a poker agent.
* The agent didn't perform well, but I got a better understanding of how machine learning/ AI works :)
* [Blog Post](/posts/poker-agent) | [Report](/poker-report.pdf) | 

### Concierge ###
**Command-Line Hotel Management Application**
* This project was morphed from a 10kLoC address book application in Java. The system has an MVC architecture.

* [Repository](https://github.com/pikulet/concierge) | [Project Portfolio](/concierge-portfolio.pdf)

### Healthcare Queuing Application ###
**Android App to manage queues at NUS UHC**
* Created an android prototype that allows NUS students to take a queue number without being physically present at the clinic.
* The project is now outdated as we integrated to the NUS system using the old IVLE LAPI.
* [Repository](https://github.com/pikulet/orbital-halp)

### SynARThesia ###
**Hack 'n' Roll 2019**
* Created a web application that demonstrates the synesthetic experience - creating artwork using music
* The site was hosted on heroku, and here I learnt about the importance of web optimisations. Our artwork generator was slow due to the rendering of images using the HTML canvas.
* [Blog Post](/posts/synarthesia) | [Demo](https://synarthesia.herokuapp.com/synarthesia.html) | [Repository](https://github.com/pikulet/HacknRoll-SynARThesia)
