> AY19/20 Semester 1

A great semester. Got to take many classes related to topics I enjoyed.

## Modules Taken
- CS2106 Introduction to Operating Systems
- CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms
- [CS3103 Computer Networks Practice](#CS3103)
- [CS4226 Internet Architecture](#CS4226)
- [CS4236 Cryptography Theory and Practice](#CS4236)
- [MA2202 Algebra I](#MA2202)
- UCV2209 The Heterogenous Indians of Contemporary Singapore

### <a id="CS3103"></a> CS3103 Computer Networks Practice

I thoroughly enjoyed the introductory networks class so I decided to do this class. This class is one of the best in NUS, in terms of the overall learning experience. Prof Anand Bhojan places great emphasis on learning rather than tests, and encourages students to ride widely outside of the class. The module gave me insights into why networking protocols were designed the way they were. This aspect was my favourite part.

### <a id="CS4226"></a> CS4226 Internet Architecture

I had expected this class to be an extension of CS2105, with lots of protocols and network design. However, I was very wrong! The first half of the module was titled resource allocation, but is essentially a rather great introduction to Queuing Theory and the M/M/1 model. I've never worked with modelling problems involving Poisson distributions previously, so I definitely learnt new content here.

The last part of the class was even more interesting, as it was on Software Defined Networking (SDN). Our project involved an exercise in Mininet (the network simulator) and POX (the controller that programs the switches in the Mininet).

### <a id="CS4236"></a> CS4236 Cryptography Theory and Practice

I'm a big fan of cryptography so this module was very fun! It was not so much learning about cryptographic constructions, but more on the primitives. A lot of focus was placed on the definitions of security and how to prove a cryptographic construction is secure. The finals were from a reversed perspective; it was very fun because we had to prove why the given constructions were insecure. This task involves finding inputs that can break the system.

### <a id="MA2202"></a> MA2202 Algebra I

I took this class as preparation for number theory, but also to complement to cryptography class. This class is about group theory. Understanding group theory helped me to round up some of the learning points in the cryptography class, such as why DDH is not hard over Zp\*. In the cryptography class, the prof would just say "because you could distinguish quadratic residues" but I got to understand that the quadratic residues are actually a subgroup of Zp\*. The solution is to use a prime-order subgroup of Zp\*, because prime-order subgroups cannot have any more subgroups (by Lagrange Theorem).
