‘New’ takes place in both large and small changes around us, from entering a new environment to picking up a new habit. What distinguishes trying something new from merely going through change is that the former involves an element of active choice of venturing into the unknown. Though the path fills us with doubt and uncertainty, that very lack of predictability is what makes the journey exciting.

Growing up, I have always basked in the familiarity of plain foods, never opting for a drizzle of that specialty sauce over my food. Fishball Noodles was my first (and perhaps only) go-to choice at the food court, because there was no need to try something new. Yet, there is something so stale about the status quo – we gradually grow accustomed to the pleasurable feelings of our routine, and seek another routine.

It is undeniable growing up changes our palate and makes us want to try more things. Despite that, I think that the stories told by fervent supporters of spicy foods – excited descriptions of a foreign sensation – were a stronger driving force. They rave about heat which opened their pores and made beads of sweat trickle down their face, the cleansing feeling of having their airways opened. How could I leave my curiosity towards a foreign sensation hanging?

Trying out spicy foods wasn’t just about completing the 5 tastes of sourness, sweetness, bitterness, spiciness, saltiness (which are not entirely representative of the human experience of taste). Besides introducing a new dimension to the way I consume food, I built a new connection with my peers who have always relished the tangible tinge of spiciness. It also gave me the satisfaction of having overcome my hitherto-existent psychological barrier against trying spicy foods, of having taken a small step in the conquest of the self.

Yet, novelty is a double-edged sword and it is easy to just fall into the devil’s trap, engaging in new activities like vices. But at the end of the day, who says that falling going down the “wrong way” is bad? There’s always something that we can learn from the new things we try, and that is perhaps the greatest lesson any new experience can give us – something we have not learnt before. At the end of it all, it is important to recognise that our actions are guided by the conflicting demands for adventure and safety, guided by our ability to judge and take risks. Striking a balance on the scales of risk and reward requires a discerning mind and experience, and how will we gain this very experience without trying something new?

There is no way to define what ‘new’ actually is – the path each of us is taking is new to ourselves. Though the act of trying something new has been so widely encouraged that it may seem to be an anathema to novelty, it is only through trying something new will one be able to understand the benefits (and necessity) of trying something new.
