This winter break, I got the chance to attend the 2nd Google Data Center Workshop. This workshop covered everything from assembling hardware components to performance analysis of the data center. It has given me newfound appreciation for the role of Data Centers and how they are the hidden backbone of Google's products.

Last year, Google [announced that a third data center will be built in Singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/google-building-third-data-centre-in-singapore-with-likely-added). This is really impressive considering how Singapore is land-scarce. Besides cheap options, data centers need to be kept safe. Furthermore, the proximity will improve the speed of Google's services in Singapore. 

I haven't really thought through what are other reasons Singapore was chosen, but this definitely came as a surprise. Data centers are usually in remote locations (for cost savings) and colder countries (to cool the racks). 

Now, here is where the stereotype of data centers as overheated warehouses comes in. But wait. Google's Data Centers are actually generating and using renewable energy. The company has been Carbon Neutral since 2007.

Also got the meet a few friends there, and even my cousin. After the workshop, we were invited to apply for next summer's Data Center Internship. That would be really fun, but I've already set my sights on going to GovTech this year. Is it a missed opportunity?
