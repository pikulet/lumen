## Personal Values (cc. 2016)

Confucius aptly wrote in the Book of Rites that bringing world peace starts with the cultivation of the self. World peace starts small, from how we see ourselves, to how we treat our peers, and eventually to how we contribute to society. 

Shaped by my environment and past experiences, a few core beliefs guide me. As an individual, contentment is the most important virtue. Appreciating what we already have, instead of feeling inadequate over things we do not own, give us lasting happiness. For example, as I desire to get a placement in various university courses and programmes, I am aware that I have to accept the outcome and work towards my goals from where I will go. 

When pursuing different opportunities, I believe in making the most out of the situation, making every happening (small or large) a learning opportunity. Yet, we cannot create a false dichotomy between contentment and ambition, peace and purpose. Each day, we have to work to find a harmonic balance between the two, redefining our understanding of fundamental values.

Recognising the importance of the individual lets me better capitalise on what is within my internal locus of control. My other identities – a daughter, friend and citizen – all start with me being an individual. This extension of identity is exemplified when interacting with others. Being tactful is an individual skill we hone, which is imperative in effective communication in different spheres – at home, at work and on the street. Whenever there is a breakdown in communication, the first thing I turn back to is how I can change to improve the situation. This does not allude to self-deprecation and blaming, but instead to a process of personal growth.

Indeed, we can harness the power of the individual to change the world, starting from ourselves.

## Do what you love... and love what you do

>> “Chase your dreams!”, “Follow your passion!”, “Listen to your heart!”

At this age when I am at a new crossroad in life, offered many choices and having many decisions to make, a conventional piece of advice would be to do what I love. This advice has been offered to me countless times, by teachers, peers, parents and even strangers on TedTalks. 

Of course, this saying is backed by a multitude of success stories, of people who have worked hard for their seemingly impossible dreams, disregarding the superficial pragmatism which governs a large part of society. In the end, the ideology behind this advice encapsulates the perennial idea that “happiness is priceless, and this priceless feeling will be worth the chase.”

But to me, doing what we love is an idyllic situation. It is where we are able to spend the limited time we have living, to bring us the maximum happiness possible. Yet, considering how many people are born into their destinies and confined by low social mobility, I questioned if we really have the choice to do what we love. This thought was also complemented by lingering practical concerns, about how what we love may not be what helps us live. Did this suggest that those who could not do what they loved were unhappy?

I thought about small towns of the past where the whole village would specialise in, master, and take pride in their craft. In those circumstances, their craft (such as iron welding, mining or farming) was likely the only activity they knew of or the only activity they had access to which could offer them a livelihood. This led me to believe that what we love is determined by what we have been doing all along.

Many people in the world have insatiable desires, perpetual dreams to chase for something far and unreachable. However, being a believer in contentment, I see more value in appreciating our circumstances and making the most out of them. In situations we cannot control, the optimistic response would be to face life with a positive attitude and an open mind.

Personally, as a child, I was not exposed to many fields within the study of the humanities, having a limited reading appetite. However, through school lessons and external activities, the world of Geography was revealed to me. Gradually, I understood what gave others the passion in Geography, and developed my own passion for the subject in school. This trend could be extrapolated to other areas, and I found myself in a situation where I craved to learn anything under the sun. 

In essence, we all start with zero exposure and interest in things we do not know of. An initial exposure to something generates a slight interest in us, to want to find out what it is about. This interest prompts us to gain more exposure, and by further exploring the depths of something, we find out more about things we did not know we did not even know. This process heightens our interest and aptitude in that area, two complementing parameters in learning. Eventually, we are drawn into that something, and we develop what I would call “love” for it.

These analyses, coupled with my own experiences, have convinced me that it is essential to approach life with an open heart and mind, and be willing to learn new things. It is with such an attitude that we are able to understand and appreciate how our life is worth our love. We may not be doing what we love, but we have the choice to love what we do!

## Why try something new?

‘New’ takes place in both large and small changes around us, from entering a new environment to picking up a new habit. What distinguishes trying something new from merely going through change is that the former involves an element of active choice of venturing into the unknown. Though the path fills us with doubt and uncertainty, that very lack of predictability is what makes the journey exciting.

Growing up, I have always basked in the familiarity of plain foods, never opting for a drizzle of that specialty sauce over my food. Fishball Noodles was my first (and perhaps only) go-to choice at the food court, because there was no need to try something new. Yet, there is something so stale about the status quo – we gradually grow accustomed to the pleasurable feelings of our routine, and seek another routine.

It is undeniable growing up changes our palate and makes us want to try more things. Despite that, I think that the stories told by fervent supporters of spicy foods – excited descriptions of a foreign sensation – were a stronger driving force. They rave about heat which opened their pores and made beads of sweat trickle down their face, the cleansing feeling of having their airways opened. How could I leave my curiosity towards a foreign sensation hanging?

Trying out spicy foods wasn’t just about completing the 5 tastes of sourness, sweetness, bitterness, spiciness, saltiness (which are not entirely representative of the human experience of taste). Besides introducing a new dimension to the way I consume food, I built a new connection with my peers who have always relished the tangible tinge of spiciness. It also gave me the satisfaction of having overcome my hitherto-existent psychological barrier against trying spicy foods, of having taken a small step in the conquest of the self.

Yet, novelty is a double-edged sword and it is easy to just fall into the devil’s trap, engaging in new activities like vices. But at the end of the day, who says that falling going down the “wrong way” is bad? There’s always something that we can learn from the new things we try, and that is perhaps the greatest lesson any new experience can give us – something we have not learnt before. At the end of it all, it is important to recognise that our actions are guided by the conflicting demands for adventure and safety, guided by our ability to judge and take risks. Striking a balance on the scales of risk and reward requires a discerning mind and experience, and how will we gain this very experience without trying something new?

There is no way to define what ‘new’ actually is – the path each of us is taking is new to ourselves. Though the act of trying something new has been so widely encouraged that it may seem to be an anathema to novelty, it is only through trying something new will one be able to understand the benefits (and necessity) of trying something new.

## A fundamental part of my identity

The end of school was the start of my world – a world of games.

The sound of cards shuffling, and dice rolling on the veneer of the small wooden table – that is the sound of an ongoing game, an experience which is a microcosm of reality. Many of my friends perceive the word “gaming” with a negative connotation, as a frivolous activity to engage in. In the worst instances, it compromises on our performance in the academic race. However, gaming has very much been a part of my life since I was young – I have grown up with it, grown to understand the good and the bad, and grown to love it.

Games have multifarious manifestations, from recreational sports to the classical gathering of friends around a table to the online realm. I have always been fascinated by the creative rules and mechanisms each game presents – from the collaborative play of Pandemic to the competitive atmosphere in Monopoly. These experiences are one of the best ways spend time with friends; they were the platforms through which a hitherto socially-awkward person crawled out of her shell to strike conversations with others. 

Besides that, I learnt to manoeuvre to delicate balance of competition. From the person obsessed about winning every game, I grew to appreciate the time spent with a fellow challenger, whilst still giving my best in an intellectual stimulation. As I grew older, my experience with gaming shifted toward the virtual world, where I got to connect with people around the world.

However, my experience with gaming has not been all that positive. When school could not meet my intellectual, social and emotional needs, I sought gaming as a way to let the days pass. Yet, this indulgence insidiously transformed into a habit, into an addiction. Addiction wasn’t just about yearning to stay connected with the game; that was only a small part of what I felt. More significantly, I felt that the virtual identity I took up was a comfortable refuge, and my identity was dissociating from reality.

Then came this moment when conflicting thoughts began to fill my 12-year-old mind as I took a step back to evaluate my life, a life I felt was being wasted away. Ever since then, I was slowly but surely leaving behind my addiction behind. To my surprise, kicking away an addiction is not all that difficult because there are so many alternative activities awaiting us in life. For me, it was reading. My interest in gaming mechanisms extended to dystopian novels, where I could temporarily immerse myself in different social constructs, which provide convenient escapisms from reality.

Instead of trying to erase this experience from my past, I have come to accept it. Reflecting on the experience let me see it in a more positive light, as a journey that has helped shape who I am today. I discovered how much dedication and energy I had to channel towards doing the things I liked, and also saw how I was one who could see the good in everything. This optimism made me hopeful about school and life. Now, I believe that every individual has a potential, likely hidden underneath a veil of expectations and rules cast by society. With patience and determination, along with a spoonful of belief in ourselves, this potential can eventually be brought out. In fact, games are tools to achieve this potential.

The realm of games is a large part of my identity not because I was born with a passion for it. Rather, a bittersweet memory of it is etched in my mind after many years of a turbulent relationship. To this day, I will look back and remember the days of being entertained for hours by a soma cube, feeling grateful to have had the opportunity to immerse in the wonders of unstructured play.

Games are so much fun, and so much more than fun. 

## What kind of Singapore would you like to see in 15 years’ time?

We all know the national narrative: economic prosperity, home ownership, and healthcare provision – these were just some of the goals which Singapore has achieved in the past few decades, despite the unfavourable circumstances many saw her to be in. This past inspires me about the possibilities of the future, which I choose to face with optimism. 

An idealistic vision would depict Singapore as a bustling economic hub which offers a high quality of life for all her people. Though elusive, this vision provides hope for us, and will continue to be the equilibrium we seek. Many areas for improvement have been identified, but I feel that the following are two key ones.

Firstly, there is a much-needed paradigm shift on the meaning of economic growth. Beyond an infinite pursuit for better economic prospects, we have to progress in a sustainable manner and place greater emphasis on two other core pillars - society and the environment. Else, we risk destabilising the very foundation upon which economic growth takes place.

For social sustainability, there is a need to narrow the socio-economic disparity not just in terms of the money. We can afford to be more empathetic towards the less fortunate and minority groups, proactively interacting with them and integrating our different ways of life together. Extending a helping hand to and interacting with people in our community is not something done only by those who bear the titles of "social worker" or "volunteer", but everyone. Ultimately, I do hope that our perceived dimensions of community will continue to widen beyond borders, and what we strive for will not be a “better country” but a “better world”. This means being more open and kind to people outside our national borders. On all fronts, more convicted effort has to be in place.

Secondly, I want to be in a Singapore where we can each have our own aspirations and priorities, whilst wanting and being able to participate in a national narrative. Responsible discourse is vital in sieving out what we espouse or eschew, and understanding the direction in which we want to move. Education plays a key role in nurturing a community which can do so. I hope that Singapore will continue to believe and invest in our education system. Ultimately, our education system should nurture critical thinkers who can responsibly critique on the education system itself. This develops a self-learning nation, where the community has the resilience to identify and solve its own problems.

In all, our visions give us something to strive towards, but we have to set realistic goals to bring us closer to realising these visions in the short time-span of 15 years. I hope that we will not just dare to dream, but sincerely take action, one step at a time. When I look back to this day in 2032, I hope to say that we have come so far in these 15 years, and I am glad to have taken the journey with everyone else in Singapore.
