description: "A reflection of a module on the history of Indian migration in Singapore"
---

Last semester, I took UCV2209 The Heterogenous Indians of Contemporary Singapore. Being non-Indian and coming from a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school with a strong Chinese culture, I was new to this. 

The first half of the class covered the history of Singapore-India relations and migratory patterns which resulted in an already heterogenous Indian population in Singapore. The second half was more topical - each week involved a guest speaker and a field trip to a cultural site. 

In one session, we even had Minister S Iswaran (current Minister for Communications and Information and former CEO of SINDA). I had a great time listening to his views, and also being very surprised at the knowledge he had about upcoming 5G technology and the impact on the Singapore information scene.

For my paper in this class, I chose to examine the differences in Deepavali and Diwali. I started off by showing my interviewees this photo from the Public Utilities Board (PUB) Facebook Page and the accompanying response:

The Deepavali-Diwali divide is actually part of a larger Hindi-Tamil divide, and what I did was to reason why these differences arose, why the debate is important to the Indian community in Singapore, and what the debate signifies about the heterogeneity of the Indian community.

It was definitely a challenging experience tying together the concepts we learnt and the insights my Indian friends shared.
