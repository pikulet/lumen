> AY17/18 Semester 2

First semester switching to CS, I avoided the Mathematics modules to give myself a break. I was pretty scarred from MA1102R Calculus, but I'm still intending to take some mathematics modules.

Nothing much to say for this semester because these are mostly compulsory. For CS2107, you get introduced to different topics in computer security and some basic CTF challenges. I didn't learn many new things, but I would say that for absolute beginners to the field it's a low-risk way to see if computer security studies is for you.
