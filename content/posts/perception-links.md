The perception class I took last semester required us to do fortnightly presentations on a variety of brain and eye anatomy. There are some really interesting ethical points that can be drawn from these presentations, even though I mig eventually forget most of the science.

## Northern Fur Seals

This assignment required us to study the **Umwelt** of an animal. I picked the northern fur seal as I was interested in asymmetric sleep patterns, where only one side of the brain falls asleep.

## Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)

Our brain works in mysterious ways, and one of which is the contralateral organisation we have. This means that our left brain controls the right side of the body, and vice versa. However, it does not always work this way. The LGN has both contra- and ipsi- lateral mappings, which raise questions on why we have such a design in the first place.

## Drugs

I used to be very aversive of drugs due to their bad street reputation, but this class has really made me appreciate the broader questions associated with drugs. In particular, I did some reflection on the implications of "dissociative" drugs and the theory of an embodied mind. Does taking these drugs bring us into a state of Cartesian dualism?
