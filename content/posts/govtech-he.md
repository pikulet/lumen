description: "An internship on Homomorphic Encryption"

This summer, I had the opportunity to join the GovTech Cybersecurity Group. I was paired with my mentor from the GovTech Girls In Tech Programme, and that really helped me tide through the work-from-home internship because at least I knew someone!

I self-proposed my internship topic, and that process made me think from the perspective of the management. What kinds of projects are worth investing in?

In the end, I decided on the topic of Homomorphic Encryption. I did the usual reading up on what it is and identified key areas of interest where applications could be developed. I then started out developing an application using the [Microsoft SEAL BFV Library](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL).

One of the key concerns surrounding Homomorphic Encryption technology (on top of its esoteric nature) is that it's very very impractical. As a result, my project ended up doing a lot of performance analysis to measure running time, disk usage and network usage in practical homomorphic encryption applications.

Nearing the end of my internship, I was invited to share about the topic with more than 150 staff from the department. Many were very curious about the technology, and I received questions about how HE would align with other major technologies like blockchain and machine learning.

All in all, GovTech is a really cool place to spend a summer at. I only wished that the internship could take place in-person so that I could get to meet more people and experience the culture there.

My presentation can be found [here](/homomorphic-encryption-ppt.pdf).
