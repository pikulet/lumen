Super glad to have graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Computing (Computer Science) with Highest Distinction. I wrote quite a bit on my honours dissertation in the previous post, so do check that out if you're interested.

I'm big on multi-disciplinary learning and connecting universal human concepts across different fields. During my time at NUS, I've also completed the University Scholars Program and a minor in Mathematics. This combination of academic programs has worked very well, and I may talk more about how I built the curricular synergies to give myself a Unique education.

I've also picked up a couple of cool awards along the way, in case anyone wanted to know. I got two commendation letters for doing well in computer science classes, one from the professor and one from the vice-dean. I've also gotten on the the School of Computing Dean's List and the USP Presidential Honour Roll.
