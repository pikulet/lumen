This year, I wanted to do something different and try out AOC on a new programming language. What better language to turn to than Golang! Things turned out pretty well at first but then I found myself not exploiting Golang's best features (the famous concurrency boosts, slices... what else are there I've yet to discover?) in making my solutions efficient. 

> Mentally, was I turning to my comfort language (Python) and then translating the code to Golang? Does this even count as programming in Golang?

This process made me reflect a bit on the nature of how we think. When I'm thinking of code, am I thinking in a specific programming language (e.g. Python), or is there some language-neutral logical thought going on there? 

Outside of programming, anthropolinguists and neuroscientists have endeavoured to prove or disprove the existence of a universal thought language, **Mentalese**. Proponents of Mentalese claim that whether we speak English, Japanese or a rare variant of Telugu, we represent our thoughts in the same manner. My thoughts? Language definitely shapes how we think (as in the linguistic relativity of the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis), and people of different cultures are known to have differences in their perception of abstract concepts like numbers, time and space. 

When I made the opening question, I was reflecting on how it's common to **say Chinese but speak in English** in Singapore. While the words mouthed are in Chinese, the structure of the sentences and the values encompassed are very Western. Is this the same thing happening, where I'm writing Golang but programming in Python?

Regardless, I can't let go of the allure of there being a universal way of thought like the Logic that is ubiquitous in software engineering. The programming language may enforce certain paradigms like Imperative versus Functional Programming, and this shapes the way we think how software should be written. 

However, there are underlying skills that transcend all programming languages and these are the ones that matter when Python becomes old (Python's already twenty, older than some freshmen). Even though language-independent skills are paramount, there's still a need to delve deep into the mechanisms of how some programming languages work. This way, we're able to pick up on underlying patterns of thought and perhaps pave the way for a language that would be popular in the future.

### What actually happened in AOC2020 ###

I got tempted by the leaderboard. In order to complete puzzles the quickest, I had to use Python :P For the first few days, I had already solved the problems in Python. Mentally, I already had a map of the solution the way I had it implemented in Python. 

Rather unfortunately, when I re-did the questions in Golang, I was doing nothing more than syntax matching and recovery. However, I'm still glad to have picked up on Golang basics. More importantly, I started connecting with the Golang community and I definitely hope to learn more from the many experts around.

Midway through AOC, I had to leave my computer at home. I wasn't home for a whole week and ended up missing quite a bit. Alas, the hole of missed days gapes at me, too wide to be missed. I didn't want to stop at Day 13 and continue on Day 21 without having done anything in between, and I can't deny how laziness also set in. Next year, I tell myself again, next year.
