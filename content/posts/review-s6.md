### <a id="CS3236"></a> CS3236 Introduction to Information Theory

This class sounds really theoretical at first but I thoroughly enjoyed it and found many connections to other things I've studied. The most obvious one would be cryptography, but I actually found connections between this module and some readings I've done on the brain. I think it's great to gain insight into how to think from a very different perspective. 

The class was really doable with only midterms, finals and one project. The prof is really great at explaining everything too. One of my favourite classes this semester.
