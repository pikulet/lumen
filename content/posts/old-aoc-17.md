At the dawn of this year's winter, I had just made the switch from Mathematics to Computer Science. By now, I was fairly confident of my intuition of basic programming concepts.

I decided to join my friends in the 2017 Advent of Code. Advent of Code release 25 puzzles over the 25 days leading to Christmas, functioning very much like an Advent calender. Every day, a new challenge is released. Depending on how fast you solve these puzzles, you get stars in a leaderboard.

For instance, if you play with 3 friends, then on your private leaderboard the first person to complete each puzzle gets 3 stars. It's a simple scoring system that really brings out the competitive spirit in fellow programmers. More than that, it keeps us active during a lull period where there would be no lessons (and hence no compulsory programming).

The puzzles started out simple, where I got used to opening and reading files in python.

However, having a lack of advanced data structures and algorithms knowledge, I got stuck at a third of the way. For the next 2 to 3 days, I ended up looking at how my friends had solved them. I took the opportunity to learn from them, a reminder that it's important to surround ourselves with people help us grow. 

Eventually, my friends got busy and no one actually persisted through 25 days. Hopefully, we will have another go next year!
