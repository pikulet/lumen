Just two months ago, my sister and I came up with the idea of (seriously) working together on some project. We picked something that we would both enjoy - a game project. The idea was for us to build two independent projects separately, but they would come together for the final product. 

As usual, I wanted to also make use of this opportunity to do something new. In the end, we decided to go for a Telegram word game. My sister would make the bot-user interactions using the `python-telegram-bot` package, while I would make a game engine and serve the backend functions as a python package.

The game we picked is a word game called Ghost, as played on [epicmafia](epicmafia.com). I love word games and word plays, so one thing I'm looking forward to is to introduce this game to my friends when we're done with it! (Of course, introducing it to them via our bot).

We've spent about a week on it so far, on-and-off between online classes, wherever our schedule permits. However, we took a break when interviews, project deadlines and examinations set in. This winter, I'm definitely hoping to have more time to work on it together. It would be something like a hackathon-at-home, where we'd huddle in a room and work on it together, throwing ideas off each other.

Will definitely update with another post, but it's been such fun to be creating projects with your favourite people.
