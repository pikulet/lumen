The end of school was the start of my world – a world of games.

The sound of cards shuffling, and dice rolling on the veneer of the small wooden table – that is the sound of an ongoing game, an experience which is a microcosm of reality. Many of my friends perceive the word “gaming” with a negative connotation, as a frivolous activity to engage in. In the worst instances, it compromises on our performance in the academic race. However, gaming has very much been a part of my life since I was young – I have grown up with it, grown to understand the good and the bad, and grown to love it.

Games have multifarious manifestations, from recreational sports to the classical gathering of friends around a table to the online realm. I have always been fascinated by the creative rules and mechanisms each game presents – from the collaborative play of Pandemic to the competitive atmosphere in Monopoly. These experiences are one of the best ways spend time with friends; they were the platforms through which a hitherto socially-awkward person crawled out of her shell to strike conversations with others. 

Besides that, I learnt to manoeuvre to delicate balance of competition. From the person obsessed about winning every game, I grew to appreciate the time spent with a fellow challenger, whilst still giving my best in an intellectual stimulation. As I grew older, my experience with gaming shifted toward the virtual world, where I got to connect with people around the world.

However, my experience with gaming has not been all that positive. When school could not meet my intellectual, social and emotional needs, I sought gaming as a way to let the days pass. Yet, this indulgence insidiously transformed into a habit, into an addiction. Addiction wasn’t just about yearning to stay connected with the game; that was only a small part of what I felt. More significantly, I felt that the virtual identity I took up was a comfortable refuge, and my identity was dissociating from reality.

Then came this moment when conflicting thoughts began to fill my 12-year-old mind as I took a step back to evaluate my life, a life I felt was being wasted away. Ever since then, I was slowly but surely leaving behind my addiction behind. To my surprise, kicking away an addiction is not all that difficult because there are so many alternative activities awaiting us in life. For me, it was reading. My interest in gaming mechanisms extended to dystopian novels, where I could temporarily immerse myself in different social constructs, which provide convenient escapisms from reality.

Instead of trying to erase this experience from my past, I have come to accept it. Reflecting on the experience let me see it in a more positive light, as a journey that has helped shape who I am today. I discovered how much dedication and energy I had to channel towards doing the things I liked, and also saw how I was one who could see the good in everything. This optimism made me hopeful about school and life. Now, I believe that every individual has a potential, likely hidden underneath a veil of expectations and rules cast by society. With patience and determination, along with a spoonful of belief in ourselves, this potential can eventually be brought out. In fact, games are tools to achieve this potential.

The realm of games is a large part of my identity not because I was born with a passion for it. Rather, a bittersweet memory of it is etched in my mind after many years of a turbulent relationship. To this day, I will look back and remember the days of being entertained for hours by a soma cube, feeling grateful to have had the opportunity to immerse in the wonders of unstructured play.

Games are so much fun, and so much more than fun.
