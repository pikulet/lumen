Confucius aptly wrote in the Book of Rites that bringing world peace starts with the cultivation of the self. World peace starts small, from how we see ourselves, to how we treat our peers, and eventually to how we contribute to society. 

Shaped by my environment and past experiences, a few core beliefs guide me. As an individual, contentment is the most important virtue. Appreciating what we already have, instead of feeling inadequate over things we do not own, give us lasting happiness. For example, as I desire to get a placement in various university courses and programmes, I am aware that I have to accept the outcome and work towards my goals from where I will go. When pursuing different opportunities, I believe in making the most out of the situation, making every happening (small or large) a learning opportunity. Yet, we cannot create a false dichotomy between contentment and ambition, peace and purpose. Each day, we have to work to find a harmonic balance between the two, redefining our understanding of fundamental values.

Recognising the importance of the individual lets me better capitalise on what is within my internal locus of control. My other identities – a daughter, friend and citizen – all start with me being an individual. This extension of identity is exemplified when interacting with others. Being tactful is an individual skill we hone, which is imperative in effective communication in different spheres – at home, at work and on the street. Whenever there is a breakdown in communication, the first thing I turn back to is how I can change to improve the situation. This does not allude to self-deprecation and blaming, but instead to a process of personal growth.

Indeed, we can harness the power of the individual to change the world, starting from ourselves.
