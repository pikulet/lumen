description: "A recommendation for the Coursera course on GCP Fundamentals"
---

NUS has very kindly sponsored students to take up Coursera courses for free. I've been taking many courses during my free time, but one of the most useful/ applicable courses would definitely be on GCP Fundamentals. This course is like that cheatsheet you needed to find out about what features GCP offers. 

It can be completed within a day (8 hours), and covers the content at just the right level you need to know. After "graduating" from this course, you would have a good sense of which GCP features to turn to should you need anything. For instance, if you're looking to simply deploy applications, then you would know that App Engine would be most suitable. 

There are also very handy summaries not available anywhere else on the internet!

I'm definitely not a cloud expert but at least I know where to look for more information should I need anything. 

If you're one of the lucky ones to get the Coursera sponsorship, to make use of the oppportunity to access the wealth of learning materials online! While these are also available without the subscription fee, I believe you won't get full access to the full deal, which includes hands-on Qwiklabs sessions. You'll also be able to earn a not-so-useful [certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/3REEQ3QHX8LX).
