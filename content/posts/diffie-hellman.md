## Key Exchange Protocols

When the internet first started, universities and research institutes would lay cables from one end to the other. No communication would pass by another eavesdropper, as the very cables were secured. However, when the modern internet involved, packets were sent everywhere. To visit a website hosted in America (e.g. Netflix), the packet would pass through many routers based in many countries. How then, can any communication be secure if no secure channel can be established?

In most cryptographic communication, both communicating parties (Alice and Bob) need to know a shared secret. This way, any messages encrypted using this secret key cannot be decrypted by malicious listeners. However, before the communication can be encrypted using the key, Alice and Bob need to decide on the secret key that they will be using. During this decision process, the communication channel is still insecure and susceptible to eavesdropping.

For instance, Alice cannot simply tell Bob that the key will be 81729312 as eavesdroppers will also know the key. Key Exchange Protocols are designed to allow Alice and Bob to agree on a shared secret key even with an eavesdropper present. One class of key exchange protocols is the **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**.

## Diffie-Hellman Protocol

The mathematical solution of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is elegant. Two parties exchange messages with each other in public, much like two people talking to each other in public. At the end of the protocol, they can decide on a shared key that no one else knows. The important factor is that information is not exactly shared during the exchange â€“ **information is created**.

Having precise assumptions in cryptography is important. These assumptions become the only uncertainty in the cryptosystem. **Mathematically intractable** problems form the basis of most modern cryptosystems.

Underlying assumptions should be precisely stated (for instance, that factoring prime numbers is difficult). The DH protocol is based so strongly on the proof of hardness of a mathematical problem that if one day, a new algorithm would solve it easily, then the Diffie-Hellman protocol would be insecure. Being able to **reduce** an entire protocol to a mathematical problem makes for an easy way to quantify the security of the protocol. 

### Cyclic Groups

Diffie-Hellman mathematics is based on operations in cyclic groups. We first give an introduction to cyclic groups. Consider a generator `g` and a modulus `n`. The group `<g>` is defined as `<g, g^2, g^3, ..., > modulus n`.

```
Example: g = 3, n = 23, 

then <g> 
= <3, 3^2 mod 23, 3^3 mod 23 ... > 
= < 3, 9, 4, 12, 13, 16, 2, 6, 18, 8, 1 > 
```

Note that the group `<g>` is **finite** (order = `11` elements) because the operations are done over modulus `n`. The maximum number of elements in the group is `n`.

### Diffie-Hellman Problems

To help relate group mathematics with the applications of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol, we first formulate a few mathematical problems.

**Discrete Logarithm (DL) Problem**

> Given `x`, find `r` such that `x` = `g^r`. Example: Let `g = 3`, in modulus `23`. Given `x = 8`, find `r` such that `8 = 3^r mod 23`.

Since we have already generated the whole group earlier, we get r = 10. However, it is generally difficult to compute `r` without generating the entire group.
 
**Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) Problem**

> Given `g^a` and `g^b`, find `g^ab`. Example: Let `g = 3`, in modulus `23`. Given `3^a = 4`, `3^b = 16`, find `3^ab`.

First, we solve for `a = 3` and `b = 6`. Then,

```
3^ab 
= 3^18 
= 3^(11 + 7) 
= 3^11 (3^7) 
= 1 (3^7)
= 2 (mod 23)
```

Notice that we solved the DL problem to solve the CDH problem. Hence, DL is easy => CDH is easy.
 
**Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) Problem**

> Given `g^a`, `g^b`, distinguish between a random `g^c` and `g^ab`. Example: Let `g = 3`, in modulus `23`. Given `3^a = 4`, `3^b = 12`. Now, given `8` and `3`, decide which is `g^ab` and which is `g^c`.

We first solve for `a = 3` and `b = 4`, `3^ab = 3^12 = 3^11 (3) = 3`. Hence `3 = 3^ab` and `8 = g^c`.  We solved the CDH problem to solve the DDH problem. Hence, CDH is easy => DDH is easy.
 
By comparing the three problems, we have that `DL easy => CDH easy => DDH easy`. If we can efficiently calculate the discrete logarithm in a cyclic group, then we can also solve the CDH and DDH problems in that group. Considering the *contrapositive*, we have that `DDH hard => CDH hard => DL hard`.

A group where the DDH problem is hard would be ideal for all cryptographic schemes relying on either the DDH, CDH or DL problems. CDH and DL would also be difficult in the group. However, we may not need such a powerful group satisfying all the mathematical assumptions. We only need a group that satisfies the DL intractability.

### Putting Everything Together
 
Precisely defining the Diffie-Hellman problems gave us a means to specify the mathematical assumptions made in designing the key exchange protocol.

In the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, the following events take place:

1. Alice and Bob establish `g` and a modulus `n`, which is public. This defines the cyclic group.
2. Alice and Bob each have a personal secret, `a` and `b`.
3. Alice sends Bob `A = g^a` and Bob calculates `K = g^ab = A^b`. Bob now has the key `K`.
4. Bob sends Alice `B = g^b` and Alice calculates `K = g^ab = B^a`. Alice now has the key `K`.

Since the communication is still not encrypted, any eavesdropper can retrieve everything that Alice and Bob sent to each other: `g`, `n`, `A = g^a` and `B = g^b`. Given these values, the eavesdropper must find the key `K = g^ab`. This description is exactly the **CDH problem**. Minimally, we must use a mathematical group where the CDH problem is hard. We do not necessarily need a DDH-hard group, just a CDH-hard group.

A classic example of a group that is CDH-hard but not DDH-hard are the `Zp*` groups. Let `p` be a prime number, then `Zp* = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... , p - 1 }`.

Diffie-Hellman problems form the cryptographic foundation for many other applications, not just the key exchange protocol. However, if a cryptosystem scheme is designed based on the DDH problem, then the users must ensure that the DDH problem is hard in the cyclic group used.

### Attacking the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

However, in modern communication channels, eavesdropping is not the only problem. A CDH-hard group can only protect the key exchange from an eavesdropper. Attackers have other capabilities, such as interception.

A middleman can create a new secret `c` and calculate `g^c`.
- When Alice sends `g^a`, `M` intercepts it and sends Alice `g^c`. Alice communicates with `M` using `K_1 = g^ac`.
- When Bob sends `g^b`, `M` intercepts it and sends Bob `g^c`. Bob communicates with `M` using `K_2 = g^bc`.

Alice will think that she is communicating with Bob using `K_1`. Bob will think he is talking to Alice using `K_2`.

The problem is that the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol was never designed for authentication. The identities of both parties are never established. Even without the presence of `M`, Alice cannot confidently ascertain that the person she is talking to is indeed Bob. Authentication protocols can be used to establish that gb was indeed generated by the person Bob, such as using certificates for verification.

## Remarks

In reality, key exchange protocols like the SSL handshake being used to establish an encryption with the bank is a more complicated. Hopefully, this article has given the reader a brief understanding of the topic.
