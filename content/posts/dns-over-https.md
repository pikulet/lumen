DNS requests are usually made over UDP, in plaintext. In a bid to **introduce more privacy** in DNS traffic, DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) was published in Oct 2018 ([RFC 8484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484)). The DNS traffic will be encrypted, and appear to be like normal HTTPS traffic.

Companies are marketing DoH as a way to prevent ISPs from tracking users' web traffic, and as a way to bypass censorship in (some) countries. However, there is more to this story...

### DoH doesn't actually prevent ISPs from tracking your traffic!
- Yes, your DNS traffic remains encrypted... but
- For HTTP traffic, the destination site is in plaintext
- For HTTPS traffic, the ISP can look at the [Server Name Identification (SNI)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/) field, which is where the client indicates the hostname it wants to connect to during the TLS handshake. (The SNI field is an optional extension of TLS)
- Of course, people have also proposed [encrypting the SNI field](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-esni/history/).

### DoH has implications on security policies, and could benefit the wrong people
- Since DNS traffic is now encrypted, companies will find it harder to implement security policies (e.g. no facebook at work), possibly facilitating the spread of malware.
- Example: The malware [Godlua](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-godlua-malware-evades-traffic-monitoring-via-dns-over-https/) has abused DoH to communicate with its command and control without being easily detected.
- Example: It would be [harder to filter content like child abuse](https://news.sky.com/story/googles-chrome-browser-plans-risk-undermining-fight-against-online-child-abuse-govt-warned-11734166).

#### So, given these concerns, do we forego DNS-over-HTTPS?

- DNS-over-HTTPS has roused the security community, but the general concensus seems to be that its benefits have been overstated.
- There are other proposals like DNSSEC ([RFC 4033](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033)) and DNS-over-TLS (DoT, [RFC 7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858)), [DNSCrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSCrypt), but these also have their own security concerns.
- Privacy in our DNS traffic is important, and this is currently still a work in progress in security research!

### Readings: ####
[A quick read](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dns-over-https-causes-more-problems-than-it-solves-experts-say/)
[An elaborate discussion on privacy; also contains information on metadata leaks like SNI](https://blog.apnic.net/2019/10/03/opinion-centralized-doh-is-bad-for-privacy-in-2019-and-beyond/)

I do recommend reading and comparing the different schemes proposed to introduce privacy in DNS traffic.
