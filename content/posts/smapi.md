This article assumes that you have prior knowledge of what Stardew Valley is. If you don't, then you don't really want to continue reading here.

Stardew Valley modding is a fun process and I just wanted to make it easier. I've compiled a modded version of Stardew Valley on my Github, which is free to download. I will explain how to maintain the mods below, in an FAQ style.

## Installation Process
In case you wanted to do it all again, I went to install SMAPI, the Stardew Valley Modding API.

## Where are the mods stored?
Stardew Valley/ Mods

## How do I add new mods?
Go to nexusmods and download the mod you want.
Copy and paste the mod into the "Mods" folder

## How do I delete mods?
Delete the mod from the "Mods" folder.

## How do I run the modded version?
Run the StardewValleyModdingAPI.exe executable

## How do I run the un-modded version?
Run the StardewValley.exe executable

## How do I start multiplayer mode?
I decided that this deserves another article :)
