The pandemic has really gotten everyone cooped up at home, and Nintendo was really lucky to have just released a game like Animal Crossing: New Horizons. At the height of the craze, I learnt how to modify the game code and generate items in the game. 

It was a rather simple process to change the game code and there is even an online community around it. However, people who aren't tech-savvy are really afraid of the word hacking. At one point, Nintendo announce strict measures to clamp down on game modding / "hacking" and many laymen were very worried about what hacking meant. However, I took upon the opportunity to reflect on how games are designed and cheating detection.

Firstly, Animal Crossing features a user inventory, analogous to a personal storage database. One way Nintendo can limit game hacking is to synchronise every user's inventory in their server. This way, it would not be possible to modify the save file and still be able to join online play if the game loads the data from the server each time.

However, doing so is highly inefficient. I know some games do sync data on their own server, such as Mobile Legends (phone game). However, the key difference is that Mobile Legends charges players for in-game money. In that case, then, it makes sense to set up more advanced cheating protection since one user cheating is one less user paying money for in-game it. The issue then is that Nintendo can actually detect cheating and hacking really easily. It's just not sensible to spend resources detecting cheaters when they could invest those resources in creating new features and new games.

Gaming companies are aware when people hack their games, but have to make the decision on whether or not it's worth to set up defenses. This thought ties back well with the whole conundrum on computer security. Is it worth it to pay for anti-virus software? How much? Many companies are often reluctant to invest in system security and this unwillingness has only fueled the black hat community. 

Not going to lie though, cyber defense is very expensive. Are these costs really justified?

> We spend more money on cyber defense than we lose to cyber attacks.

Outside of security, these questions are important in every domain of life. When it comes to personal health, many people generally agree that it is worth spending a little more money to keep our bodies healthy. And it isn't just about defraying the costs of seeing a doctor. It's about well-being and a peace of mind.

## Remarks

Besides getting myself involved in hacking the game, I also ran a satirical Animal Crossing news site. You may check out the [5amcrook](https://5amcrook.netlify.app/).
