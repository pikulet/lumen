> AY18/19 Semester 1

I was taking on other roles around school (teaching assistant for CS1101S, Residential Assistant in Cinnamon College and University Scholars Club) and wanted to pace myself, so a light semester for me :) Oh and also because I'm new to software engineering.

I took CS2103 this semester because I had friends taking the class. While I didn't end up in the same group as them, I'm glad to have cleared the semester with a great team. I also wanted to do CS4236 Cryptography Theory and Practice this semester but I knew no one who wanted to do this in year 2 :(


## Modules Taken
- CS2100 Computer Organisation
- CS2103 Software Engineering
- IS1103 IS Innovations in Organisations and Society
- [MA2214 Combinatorics and Graphs I](#MA2214)
- ULT2299C Topics in Literature 2: The Subject of Reading

### <a id="MA2214"></a> MA2214 Combinatorics and Graphs I

I expected more from the module in terms of content, as H3 Mathematics already covered a good portion of the content. Nevertheless, I enjoyed learning about Generating Functions. I was actually looking forward to the graph portion but turns out it's mostly covered in part two of the module.

I bought the book because I love this topic so much, even though I already had an online copy of it. Absolutely not necessary to buy, but there are exercises inside that would help if you do get it. No answers provided, so find some friends to work on the problems together.
