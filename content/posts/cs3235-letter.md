In the field of computer security, it is common to encounter geniuses who have been working on Capture-The-Flags for many years. It can be quite frightening to study alongside them, but I always take the opportunity to learn from them instead.

Last semester, I took the module CS3235 Computer Security. While I was rather familiar with the cryptographic concepts, practical aspects like Return-Oriented Programming were more elusive. 

I'm glad to share that I received a commendation letter from the Vice-Dean for CS3235 Computer Security!
