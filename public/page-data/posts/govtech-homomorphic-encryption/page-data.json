I did the usual reading up on what it is and identified key areas of interest where applications could be developed.

Many were very curious about the technology, and I received questions about how HE would align with other major technologies like blockchain and machine learning.</p>\n<p>All in all, GovTech is a really cool place to spend a summer at.

It’s a pretty new technology developed in the last 30+ years, and there are currently limited commercial applications due to lack of specialist knowledge and industry standardisations. In recent years, tech leaders (IBM, Google,\nMicrosoft) are pushing for their widespread use.</p>\n<p>HE is fundamentally different from the current encryption systems like <code class=\"language-text\">RSA</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">AES</code>. Interestingly, HE is quantum-resistant. With the realisation of quantum computers, we can apply <strong>Schnorr’s Algorithm</strong> to solve the factorisation problems that make <code class=\"language-text\">RSA</code> secure. There is no known quantum algorithm to break HE.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-homomorphism\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-is-homomorphism\" aria-label=\"what is homomorphism permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What is Homomorphism?</h3>\n<p>In group theory, a <strong>homomorphism</strong> is a property-preserving function of the following form:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Enc(a) + Enc(b) = Enc(a + b)</code></pre></div>\n<p>The two operations <code class=\"language-text\">(Enc, +)</code> are said to be homomorphic if we can reverse their order of application and achieve the same output result.

This possibility is useful in the real world, where one company might own the data (e.g. a hospital with medical data), and another company owns the algorithm to analyse the data (e.g. a tech company). Both parties would generally be unwilling to share what they own with each other, and the conflict can be resolved with HE.</p>\n<p>We can apply HE to healthcare analytics, encrypted search (where we only index encrypted documents) and in the end-to-end verifiability of e-voting (elections can be audited without revealing individual votes).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, HE is significantly slower than existing encryption solutions and it is not <strong>CCA-Secure</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chosen-ciphertext-attack-cca-secure\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chosen-ciphertext-attack-cca-secure\" aria-label=\"chosen ciphertext attack cca secure permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chosen-Ciphertext Attack (CCA) Secure</h3>\n<p>Since the encryption function is eponymously homomorphic, adding any two ciphertexts <code class=\"language-text\">A</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">B</code> together will result in a valid ciphertext <code class=\"language-text\">C</code>. This property-preserving function leads to the problem of <strong>ciphertext malleability</strong>. Given the ciphertexts of <code class=\"language-text\">A, B and C</code>, attackers can discover that <code class=\"language-text\">C = A + B</code>. Attackers know the relationship between the ciphertexts.</p>\n<p>Note that in this scenario, the actual value of <code class=\"language-text\">C</code> is still protected since actual values of <code class=\"language-text\">A</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">B</code> are not known. However, if the attacker could somehow obtain these values, then the encryption scheme is compromised.</p>\n<p>To circumvent this problem, data owners need to ensure that the raw data cannot be\neasily accessible. However, modern microservice applications can be very complex and include multi-party communication. Rich data flows could lead to inadvertent data leaks. Nevertheless, HE by itself is still safe if it was purely one client outsourcing the computations to one server.</p>\n<p>Besides not being CCA-Secure, HE does not provide any integrity checks. The attacker can simply double every data point using homomorphic operations, changing the results Currently, the only solution is to use canaries to detect these modifications. By randomly inserting dummy data points, we can check if these data points were maliciously modified.</p>\n<h2 id=\"developing-applications-with-he\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#developing-applications-with-he\" aria-label=\"developing applications with he permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Developing applications with HE</h2>\n<p>HE refers to a broad class of encryption systems, including</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Partially HE</strong>: Some systems are only homomorphic for addition only or multiplication only, but not both</li>\n<li><strong>Somewhat HE</strong>: Some systems only support a limited number of operations</li>\n<li><strong>Fully HE</strong>: The most theoretically correct but also not practical to use</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some common HE schemes include <code class=\"language-text\">DGHV</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">BGV</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">BFV</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">CKKS</code> (these named after the researchers who developed them).

Its security premise is based on a computationally hard problem known as the <strong>Ring Learning with Error (RLWE)</strong> problem. BFV can support both asymmetric (public-key) and symmetric encryption.</p>\n<p>The BFV encryption process works by adding noise to messages. Without the key, it is difficult to decrypt the data. However, during the computation process, the noise will grow. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding two ciphertexts causes negligible growth</li>\n<li>Multiplying two ciphertexts causes the noise to almost double</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the noise exceeds a threshold value, it becomes impossible to correctly decrypt the message. A trick employed to “reset” the noise is known as <strong>bootstrapping</strong>, where a message is decrypted and then re-encrypted. However, because of the high latency of HE, this resetting is a very expensive operation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"analysis\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#analysis\" aria-label=\"analysis permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Analysis</h3>\n<p>After experimenting and doing performance analysis on this scheme, here were some findings:</p>\n<p><strong>Space Consumption</strong></p>\n<p>There was an impractically large increase in the space consumed by the encrypted data. Unencrypted integers took just <code class=\"language-text\">4</code> bytes of space, but that single digit encryption would take <code class=\"language-text\">100k</code> bytes. While I did not verify if the growth is linear for large numbers, it is still concerning for large data sets of single-digit data.</p>\n<p><strong>Limited Practical Use</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>BFV only allows for mathematically primitive operations like addition and multiplication to be done. It is expensive to piece together these operations to achieve complex functionality for use in data analytics and machine learning.</li>\n<li>The data owner has to do the encryption and decryption of the sensitive input by themselves. This operation is expensive and would consume the owner’s own resources. It’s a trade-off between spending resources on encryption versus spending on computation and analytics.</li>\n<li>Microsoft’s SEAL BFV in particular is a rather low-level library working with polynomial operations. Developers need to have an understanding of how to\nrepresent the data (integers, text) in polynomials. BFV parameters also have to be picked beforehand, based on the expected computations results - a skill not easily accessible to new developers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"remarks\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#remarks\" aria-label=\"remarks permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Remarks</h2>\n<p>Overall, Homomorphic Encryption techniques like BFV are still nascent and research-level techniques.
