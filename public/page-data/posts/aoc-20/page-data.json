What better language to turn to than Golang! Things turned out pretty well at first but then I found myself not exploiting Golang’s best features in making my solutions efficient. (The famous concurrency boosts, slices… what else are there I’ve yet to discover?)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mentally, was I turning to my comfort language (Python) and then translating the code to Golang? Does this even count as programming in Golang?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This process made me reflect a bit on the nature of how we think. When I’m thinking of code, am I thinking in a specific programming language (e.g. Python), or is there some language-neutral logical thought going on there? </p>\n<p>Outside of programming, anthropolinguists and neuroscientists have endeavoured to prove or disprove the existence of a universal thought language, <strong>Mentalese</strong>. Proponents of Mentalese claim that whether we speak English, Japanese or a rare variant of Telugu, we represent our thoughts in the same manner. </p>\n<p>My thoughts? Language definitely shapes how we think (as in the linguistic relativity of the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis), and people of different cultures are known to have differences in their perception of abstract concepts like numbers, time and space. </p>\n<p>When I made the opening question, I was reflecting on how it’s common to <strong>say Chinese but speak in English</strong> in Singapore. While the words mouthed are in Chinese, the structure of the sentences and the values encompassed are based on English grammar. Is this the same thing happening, where I’m writing Golang but programming in Python?</p>\n<p>Regardless, I can’t let go of the allure of there being a universal way of thought like the Logic that is ubiquitous in software engineering. The programming language may enforce certain paradigms like Imperative versus Functional Programming, and this shapes the way we think how software should be written. </p>\n<p>However, there are underlying skills that transcend all programming languages and these are the ones that matter when Python becomes old (Python’s already twenty, older than some freshmen). Even though language-independent skills are paramount, there’s still a need to delve deep into the mechanisms of how some programming languages work. This way, we’re able to pick up on underlying patterns of thought and perhaps pave the way for a language that would be more useful in the future.</p>\n<h4 id=\"remarks\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#remarks\" aria-label=\"remarks permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Remarks</h4>\n<p>My (incomplete) work can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/pikulet/adventofcode2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Github</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/aoc-20","tagSlugs":["/tag/advent-of-code/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-01-02","description":"A (very informal) reflection on the Advent of Code 2020 season","tags":["advent of code"],"title":"2020 Advent of Code"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/aoc-20"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3439816877","401334301"]}
